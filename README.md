<h4 align="center">A Simple Token for StarkNet</h4>

### This is an experiment
Here is a token inspired by the erc20 written for StarkNet natively. The idea is to build something with the constraints of StarkNet and not those of ethereum. If it turns out that it allows substantial performance gains, it could be wise to wrap an ERC20 token in stoken.
